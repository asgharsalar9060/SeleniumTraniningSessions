TestNG -- unit test framework
TDD -- Test Driven Development --> along with designing everything or writing codes, we can write our test cases with agile methodology 
Advantages:
1. design test cases in a systematic way
2. generate html reports
3. gives different annotations
4. define priorities/sequences of tests - which one should be tested first
5. define dependency feature
6. grouping tests
7. data provider is available
